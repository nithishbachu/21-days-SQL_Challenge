-- Day 14: Combining Tables (LEFT JOIN and RIGHT JOIN)

-- 1. Show all staff members and their schedule information (including those with no schedule entries).
SELECT s.*, ss.week, ss.present
FROM staff s
LEFT JOIN staff_schedule ss ON s.staff_id = ss.staff_id;

-- 2. List all services from services_weekly and their corresponding staff (show services even if no staff assigned).
SELECT sw.week, sw.month, sw.service, s.staff_id, s.staff_name
FROM services_weekly sw
LEFT JOIN staff s ON sw.service = s.service;

-- 3. Display all patients and their service's weekly statistics (if available).
SELECT p.*, sw.*
FROM patients p
LEFT JOIN services_weekly sw ON p.service = sw.service;

-- 4. Daily Challenge:  Create a staff utilisation report showing all staff members(staff_id, staff_name, role, service)
-- and the count of weeks they were present (from staff_schedule). Include staff members even if they have no schedule 
-- records. Order by weeks present descending.
SELECT s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.role, s.service,
COALESCE(SUM(present),0) AS count_of_weeks
FROM staff s
LEFT JOIN staff_schedule ss ON s.staff_id = ss.staff_id
GROUP BY s.staff_id, s.staff_name, s.role, s.service
ORDER BY count_of_weeks DESC;
