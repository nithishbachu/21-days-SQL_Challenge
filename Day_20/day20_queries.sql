-- Day 20: Window Functions - Aggregate Window Functions

-- 1. Calculate running total of patients admitted by week for each service.
SELECT week, service, patients_admitted, SUM(patients_admitted) OVER(PARTITION BY service ORDER BY WEEK)
FROM services_weekly;

-- 2. Find the moving average of patient satisfaction over 4-week periods.
SELECT week, service, patient_satisfaction, 
ROUND(AVG(patient_satisfaction) OVER(ORDER BY week ROWS BETWEEN 3 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS moving_avg
FROM services_weekly;

-- 3. Show cumulative patient refusals by week across all services.
SELECT week, service, patients_refused, SUM(patients_refused) OVER(ORDER BY week) AS cumulative_sum
FROM services_weekly
ORDER BY week, service, patients_refused;

-- 4. Daily Challenge: Create a trend analysis showing for each service and week: week number, patients_admitted, 
-- running total of patients admitted (cumulative), 3-week moving average of patient satisfaction (current week and 2 
-- prior weeks),and the difference between current week admissions and the service average. Filter for weeks 10-20 only.
SELECT week, service, patients_admitted, SUM(patients_admitted) OVER(PARTITION BY service ORDER BY week) running_total,
ROUND(AVG(patient_satisfaction) OVER(PARTITION BY service ORDER BY week ROWS BETWEEN 2 PRECEDING AND CURRENT ROW), 2) AS moving_avg3,
ROUND((patients_admitted - AVG(patients_admitted) OVER(PARTITION BY service)), 2) AS diff_from_avg
FROM services_weekly
WHERE week BETWEEN 10 AND 20
ORDER BY week, service;
