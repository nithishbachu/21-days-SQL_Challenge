-- Day 8: Data Manipulation(String Functions)

-- 1. Convert all patient names to uppercase.
SELECT UPPER(name) AS patient_name
FROM patients;

-- 2. Find the length of each staff member's name.
SELECT staff_name, LENGTH(staff_name) AS name_length
FROM staff;

-- 3. Concatenate staff_id and staff_name with a hyphen separator.
SELECT staff_id, staff_name, CONCAT_WS('-', staff_id, staff_name) AS staff_id_name
FROM staff;

-- 4. Daily Challenge: Create a patient summary that shows patient_id, full name in uppercase, service in lowercase, age category 
-- (if age >= 65 then 'Senior', if age >= 18 then 'Adult', else 'Minor'), and name length. Only show patients whose name length is 
-- greater than 10 characters.
SELECT patient_id, UPPER(name) AS name, LOWER(service) AS service,
CASE WHEN age >= 65 THEN 'Senior' WHEN age >= 18 AND age < 65 THEN 'Adult' ELSE 'Minor' END AS age_category, LENGTH(name) AS name_length
FROM patients
WHERE LENGTH(name) > 10;
